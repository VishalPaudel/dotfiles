### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
exec /usr/bin/swayidle -w \
    timeout 600 '/usr/bin/swaylock -f -c 000000' \
    timeout 900 '/usr/bin/swaymsg "output * power off"' resume '/usr/bin/swaymsg "output * power on"' \
    before-sleep '/usr/bin/swaylock -f -c 000000'

# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
